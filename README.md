I will study diferets models in order to predict the price of avocados

With a data obtained in Kaggle that indicates the price of avocados. I perform:
1. I study the data, clean it and analyze which ones are important to take into account in a prediction model and how important they are.

2. I carry out the study of several prediction sk-Learn models. I stick with the most accurate model, which happens to be from Random Forest.

3. I make a time series model and compare it with the Random Forest model. I analyze how and until when this model can be useful
